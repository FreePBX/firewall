# AGPL Notices
## 'System Admin' COMPLIANCE NOTE:
This package (FreePBX Firewall) currently uses an API provded by the non-open source package 'FreePBX System Admin RPM' to modify some system settings.

This is explicitly deemed by the Authors and Copyright Holders as an arms-length API abstraction layer, and is not required to be distributed to remain in compliance with the AGPL.

It is planned that this abstraction layer will be rolled into this package at some point in the future.
